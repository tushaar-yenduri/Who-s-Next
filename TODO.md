# TODO: Update Risk Driver Contributions Chart

- [x] Change BarChart layout from "vertical" to "horizontal" for vertical bars
- [x] Swap XAxis and YAxis: XAxis for factor (category), YAxis for contribution (number, domain [0,100])
- [x] Add barCategoryGap and barGap to BarChart for increased spacing
- [x] Rotate X-axis labels by -25 degrees
- [x] Verify color mapping (High: red, Medium: amber, Low: green) is preserved
- [x] Ensure rounded bar corners and subtle tooltip styling remain
